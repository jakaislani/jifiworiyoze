<time>02 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>The X-factor with Simon Cowell has indeed been a blessing from the start of the show as it has given a platform to many raw but gifted artists who have gone on to become global stars such as all boys group One Direction.&nbsp;Also of note is Leona Lewis, the British-born songbird, model and actress.</span></p><p><span>Lewis won the show in 2006 and burst into the limelight with their first album&nbsp;</span><span>Ghost</span><span>&nbsp;in 2007, which was certified 10 times platinum in the UK and also the 4th best seller (album) of the 2000s.&nbsp;Here are some interesting facts about this wonderful diva, her ethnicity, her parents and of course why we haven’t seen her as active in the music industry as what happened to her.&nbsp;Continue reading.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Leona Lewis bio, dude</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born Leona Louise Lewis in Hackney, London, on April 3, 1985, Leona Lewis grew up with her younger brother Kyle in Islington, Borough.&nbsp;She has British nationality and is of mixed ethnicity that includes African Guyana, Irish, Italian and Welsh.&nbsp;She also has an older half brother named Bradley.</span></p><p><span>Leona Lewis showed a great passion for singing from an early age, which prompted her parents to send her to the Sylvia Young Theater School, where she studied before going to the Italia Conti Academy of Theater Arts.&nbsp;Not satisfied, she attended Ravenscourt Theater School before completing her education at the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology.</span></p><p><span>Talented and young Leona Lewis wrote her own first song when she was just 12 years old.&nbsp;Her musical education was primarily based on opera before venturing into blues, jazz and other musical genres.</span></p><span>She left school at 17 to pursue her dream of being a musician and singer in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;She dropped her first demo album entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Twilight</span><span>&nbsp;but the album didn’t get her the record label she wanted so badly.&nbsp;She jogged all sorts of odd jobs to pay for her studio session on the album, which was never released publicly.</span><p><span>Thankfully, the stars smiled at her when the 3rd season of the X Factor music reality show was announced in 2006.&nbsp;She signed up for it and gave an excellent performance, winning the show with 60% of the votes cast.&nbsp;She also received the £1 million prize money and a record deal with Syco Music (owned by Simon Cowell).&nbsp;Her winning song was her remake of Kelly Clarkson’s&nbsp;</span><span>A Moment Like This.&nbsp;</span><span>The cover song made history with over 50,000 downloads in about 30 minutes and also held first place in the UK Singles Chart for 4 weeks.</span></p><p><span>That performance earned her national honors in 2006 and also a 5-album deal with US-based J Records.&nbsp;From there she launched a beautiful and lucrative music career with commercially successful songs topping various charts around the world.&nbsp;Hit songs from their debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Geist</span><span>&nbsp;(2007)&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Bleeding Love, Better&nbsp;in Time and&nbsp;Homeless&nbsp;went on to top some music charts.</span></p><p><span>The 5’6″ tall pop singer released her second album&nbsp;</span><span>Echo</span><span>&nbsp;in 2009. Her other top studio albums include&nbsp;</span><span>Glass Heart</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Christmas with Love</span><span>&nbsp;(2013) and&nbsp;</span><span>I Am</span><span>&nbsp;(2015).&nbsp;Leona Lewis has worked with various top acts throughout her singing career including Ryan Tedder, Naughty Boy, Calum Scott, Max Martin, Avicii and Justin Timberlake.</span></p><p><span>She had the opportunity to sing with Led Zeppelin at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics.&nbsp;In addition, she signed a book deal in 2009 titled&nbsp;</span><span>Dreams</span><span>&nbsp;Unfortunately, during the book signing ceremony, she was attacked by a man who was eliminated at the X Factor and left her with bruises.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, she had her first film appearance in Running in&nbsp;</span><span>the Sunshine</span><span>&nbsp;, a romantic comedy in which she took on the role of Elena.&nbsp;She then starred in the Broadway theater production of&nbsp;</span><span>Cat</span><span>&nbsp;in 2016 as Grizabella.</span></p><p><span>She has a strong voice in advocating for animal welfare and animal welfare.&nbsp;Moreso, she has over time shown support for the Little Kids Rock Foundation, a music education NGO in the&nbsp;</span><span>USA.</span></p><p><span>Her contribution to the entertainment industry hasn’t gone unnoticed as she’s been nominated for 60 awards, 33 of which have included MOBO, MTV Video and World Music Awards to name a few.</span></p><p><span>Her current net worth is estimated at $30 million, which she has amassed from her record sales, touring, a perfume line and her autobiographical book, among other things.</span></p><h2><strong><span>parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>This talented diva was born to an African-Guyanese father, Aural Josiah Lewis, and her mother, Maria Lewis, are of Welsh origins but have Irish and Italian ancestry.&nbsp;Both parents were together for 20 years before tying the knot and they have been very supportive of their daughter’s musical career.</span></p><h2><strong><span>who is her husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>Regarding Leona Lewis’s love life, she isn’t married yet, but she is engaged to her longtime partner Dennis Jauch.&nbsp;She previously had a 10-year love affair with Lou Al Chamaa, a former Sony Music employee.&nbsp;Both co-founded a clothing line that eventually wrapped up in 2012.&nbsp;They dated from 2000 to 2010 before going their separate ways.</span></p><p><span>She later met Dennis Jauch on one of her tours about 8 years ago, who became one of her backup dancers.&nbsp;Dennis Jauch is a choreographer and the two have been together since 2010, according to&nbsp;</span><span>Homeless</span><span>&nbsp;Crooner in November 2018, however the couple have not yet walked down the aisle at the time of this writing.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What happened to her?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The pop diva was rumored to have lost her voice and couldn’t hold her falsetto after her nose reconstruction surgery in 2011, but that’s far from the truth.&nbsp;The fact is that from 2007 to 2013 Leona Lewis overhauled her voice during the three major tours and concerts while performing 17 high-pitched songs (which she has compared to Celine Dion, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey) in a row for 64 nights without a break, one deed that affected her voice.&nbsp;However, this never ended her career, nor had anything to do with her disappearance from the scene.</span></p><p><span>In 2017, Leona Lewis was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease (an autoimmune disease that produces abnormal antibodies that damage the thyroid gland).&nbsp;She was very ill that she had lost some body mass and was even bedridden.&nbsp;So she took some time off to fully recover from her illness.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
