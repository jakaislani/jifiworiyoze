Selena was brought back to life by doctors and nurses. When doctors opened her chest, they discovered that there was absolutely no blood. They performed a blood transfusion on the patient. Selena was a Jehovah’s Witnesses who did not believe in blood transfusions. However, since she was unconscious, she was unable to inform medics of her religious affiliation.
