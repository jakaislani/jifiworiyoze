Let us delve deeper into his life to learn more about his personal life.</p><h2><span id=Bretman_Rock_is_one_of_his_father_and_mother8217s_two_children>Bretman Rock is one of his father and mother’s two children.</span></h2><p>Bretman Sacayanan was born on July 31, 1998, in Sanchez Mira, Philippines. Edmund Laforga and his wife raised him. His parents also have a daughter, Princess Mae, who is a renowned Instagram influencer. Mae, Bretman’s sister, is the mother of two lovely children: a girl, Cleo, with her ex-boyfriend, and a baby boy with another ex-boyfriend, Chris.</p><p>Furthermore, Bretman is of Filipino descent. He and his family moved to the island of Hawaii when he was seven years old. He attended school in Hawaii.</p><h2><span id=The_inspiration_for_his_unusual_name_came_from_WWE_wrestlers>The inspiration for his unusual name came from WWE wrestlers.</span></h2><p>Bret’s father suspected his son was gay from the start. This is why he attempted to convert him to a straight jock. He got Bretman interested in athletics and health. Bretman is still a sports fanatic and works out frequently as a result of this.</p><p>Rock’s father was a huge fan of iconic WWE wrestlers Bret Hart and The Rock at the same time. And thus the name Bretman Rock was born.</p><p>Bretman’s parents were aware of his homosexuality from an early age.</p><p>Bretman’s parents were aware of his homosexuality from the start and have always supported him, albeit indirectly. In an interview, he stated,</p><p>“I grew up very Catholic and went to church all the time, but when my father suspected I was gay, he was always very accepting of it.”</p><p>Furthermore, after discovering Bret’s sexual orientation, his father surprised him with a car filled with barbies on his fourth birthday. Bretman is frequently featured in his videos with his mother, who is open to her son’s sexuality.</p><p>Rock claims that his mother is his rock and that he is free to express himself around her. Though she does occasionally request talent fees for appearing in his videos. Intended pun!</p><p>However, without his parents, who knows whether we would have ever observed such a captivating personality as we see today?</p><h2><span id=Edmund_Laforga_Bretman8217s_father_died_in_2019>Edmund Laforga, Bretman’s father, died in 2019.</span></h2><p>His parents later divorced, and his father used to live in the Philippines. He tragically lost his father in November 2019. He died after being placed in a coma for some time.</p><p>Around the same time, Bretman called out a number of people for interfering with his personal life. The Make-Up Guru was in the Philippines for his father’s burial when a large number of ungrateful individuals approached him and took photos of him.</p><p>Because of this occurrence, Bretman even pleaded with his fans to calm down and allow him to grieve in peace.</p><h2><span id=Bretman_Rock8217s_Ethnicity_And_Nationality_Are_Unknown>Bretman Rock’s Ethnicity And Nationality Are Unknown</span></h2><p>He became an American citizen after migrating to Hawaii as a child. Bretman, on the other hand, is of Filipino descent. His mother and father were both from the Philippines.</p><h2><span id=Bretman_Rock8217s_Relationship_Status_Who_Is_He_With>Bretman Rock’s Relationship Status: Who Is He With?</span></h2><p>Bretman is not currently in a relationship. Yes, as of 2020, the jolly and silly phenomenon is not dating anyone.</p><p>His dating status, however, was not always single. In actuality, he ended his relationship with his mysterious boyfriend in September 2020. He had been dating this woman for some time, but he never divulged the identify of his now ex-girlfriend.</p><h2><span id=Bretman_Rock8217s_ex-loverBretman_has_yet_to_reveal_his_ex-boyfriend8217s_identify>Bretman Rock’s ex-lover.Bretman has yet to reveal his ex-boyfriend’s identify.</span></h2><p>Bret’s partner was continually covering his face in inventive ways in all of the images he had shared with his ex-boyfriend. Nobody knows the identity of his mystery man, yet judging by the images, he is a muscular man. And it appears that the identity will remain unknown indefinitely following their breakup.</p><p>There has been no indication of Bretman’s previous encounters with anyone other than the gentleman we discussed.</p><p>Though Bretman always kept his former partner’s identity hidden, fans were always understanding of the truth and actively backed the ex-pair.</p><h2><span id=Bretman_Rock_Partners_with_a_Cosmetics_Company>Bretman Rock Partners with a Cosmetics Company</span></h2><p>Bretman has already collaborated with major cosmetic brands such as Kylie Cosmetics and Fenty Beauty in a short period of time. At the age of 18, Time magazine named him one of the 30 Most Influential Teens. Not to add that he had his own reality show called ‘No Filter’ on the MTV network.</p><p>He has become one of the most productive beauty experts in just five years. His talent as a make-up artist is well-known across the community.</p><h2><span id=Wet_n_Wild_and_Babe_in_Paradise_are_his_own_beauty_lines>Wet n Wild and Babe in Paradise are his own beauty lines.</span></h2><p>Bret’s work with Morphe was more than enough to silence everyone who despised him. Babe in Paradise is his own bespoke palette. And, indeed, the make-up was an instant hit, selling out on the Morphe’s website.</p><p>His wet n wild Bretman Rock Shadow Palette retails at $14.99. Numerous fashion experts suggest the beauty product.</p><p>Additionally, his collaboration with Wet n Wild is selling like hotcakes. Bretman has broadened his line and created several beauty products in collaboration with the cosmetic industry, including Lip Gloss, Makeup Bag, Brushes, and so on.</p><h2><span id=Bretman_Rock8217s_Net_Worth>Bretman Rock’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>His net worth is currently $1.5 million. The sum is certain to rise soon, given his work and how many business initiatives he is involved in.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Filipino Internet Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Nefesch</a></h3>Nefesch estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
