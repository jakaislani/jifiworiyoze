It was all quite intimidating for me, but it looks lovely.”</p><h2><span id=Husband_Boyfriend_and_Dating_History_of_Madeline_Brewer>Husband, Boyfriend, and Dating History of Madeline Brewer</span></h2><p>As of the time of writing, Madeline Brewer had never confessed to having a husband or a boyfriend. She even restricted her social media postings to her extraordinary images from photoshoots, red carpet events, and other projects. However, as her fame grew, she lost control of her previously obscured private life as people became more interested in her life away from the camera.</p><p>As a result, here is a brief history of her dating life that we discovered through some digging.</p><p>Since sometime in 2016, Madeline has been linked to actor-producer Spencer Neville. They met on the set of the television series The Deleted. Spencer, who is best known for Ozark and American Horror Story, looked very cozy with the blue-eyed beauty at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival’s party. Additionally, they were spotted together in a few of Spencer’s Instagram photos.</p><p>Another actor named Calum Worthy has been added to her rumored boyfriend list. In 2020, Madeline and the Disney Channel’s heartthrob were spotted on the red carpet together at the Hulu Golden Globes After Party. And they fueled speculation, as the pair did not collaborate on any projects but were seen together at the event.</p><p>Finally, there’s our favorite and now-unavailable Nick Jonas!</p><p>Prior to Nick and Priyanka Chopra-wedding, Jonas’s fans went insane after Nick and Madeline were spotted eating dinner together. This occurred in January 2018. Although Madeline later clarified to ET at the SAG Awards that she was simply eating across from the “adorable” guy and was only friends with him.</p><p>While Madeline has long maintained that they were simply friends, Nick is technically the first (but certainly not the last!) Disney star to appear in her dating history.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>reality star</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Edward Williams Jr</a></h3>Edward Williams Jr estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
