That same year, Remini scored her first starring role with ABC’s Living Dolls, a Who’s the Boss? spin-off that also featured a young <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/halle-berry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Halle Berry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Halle Berry</a>. The show didn’t catch on, though, and Remini resumed her career with appearances on Normal Life, The Hogan Family, and Guns of Paradise. In 1991, she landed recurring parts on Man in the Family and Saved by the Bell.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Sitcom Stars</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1994, Remini tried out for the role of Monica on what became the massively popular NBC series Friends.

That same year, she landed another prominent role on a series called First Time Out, but it met a fate similar to that of Living Dolls and was cancelled after 12 episodes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1997, a leading part came along again for Remini, this time in the form of the sitcom Fired Up, which co-starred NYPD Blue’s Sharon Lawrence. The show wasn’t a smash hit, but it did last 28 episodes and provide her the exposure to land her biggest acting job to date.</p><h2 id="'The-King-of-Queens'-and-'Kevin-Can-Wait'" data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">The King of Queens and Kevin Can Wait</h2><img alt="leah remini embracing the king of queens costar kevin james for a cast photo" title="Leah Remini on the set of The King of Queens" width=985 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-king-of-queens-a-cbs-television-sitcom-premiere-episode-news-photo-1691084668.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Leah Remini starred on The King of Queens with Jerry Stiller and Kevin James starting in 1998.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 1998, Leah Remini made her first appearance opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kevin-james data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin James" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin James</a> on The King of Queens. It marked the start of a career-defining run for the actress, who again mined her New York roots for the role of sharp-tongued Carrie Heffernan, the on-screen wife of James’ delivery man character, Doug. Remini became a household name as she rode the high tide of the show, and she appeared in her first big film role, opposite Vince Vaughn in the comedy smash Old School, in 2003.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A decade after The King of Queens came to an end in 2007, Remini joined her old co-star James for the season 1 finale of the comic’s new show, Kevin Can Wait. With audiences responding favorably to the familiar pairing, Remini became a regular cast member, though Kevin Can Wait ultimately failed to survive past a second season.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 title="Hosting Gigs: 'The Talk' and 'Dancing with the Stars'" data-anchor-id=hosting-gigs-the-talk-and-dancing-with-the-stars class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Hosting Gigs: 'The Talk' and 'Dancing with the Stars'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beginning in 2010, Remini served as an original co-host of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sara-gilbert data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sara Gilbert" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sara Gilbert</a>’s daytime show, The Talk.

I can’t do that. That (was) maybe not a good fit in that way,” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2013, Remini took on the lead role on ABC’s Family Tools, an adaptation of the BBC series White Man Van, as well as a different type of TV project by competing on Season 17 of Dancing with the Stars, eventually finishing in fifth place. She later returned as co-host of the popular dance competition show for two seasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014, she debuted Leah Remini: It’s All Relative, a reality TV show that also featured her husband and daughter.
