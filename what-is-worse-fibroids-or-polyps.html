The cause of uterine fibroids and polyps is not clear but may be linked to genetics or the hormones estrogen and progesterone.<h2>Can a doctor tell if a polyp is cancerous by looking at it?</h2>A gastroenterologist, the specialist who usually performs a colonoscopy, can't tell for certain if a colon polyp is precancerous or cancerous until it's removed and examined under a microscope.<h2>Is it painful to have polyps removed?</h2>A person may feel pressure or pulling during the procedure, but they should feel no pain. Depending on the location of the polyp and other factors, a doctor may give the person pain-blocking medication before, during, or after the procedure.<h2>What size fibroids need surgery?</h2>Most experts believe that about 9-10 centimeters (about 4 inches) diameter is the largest size fibroid that should be removed laparoscopically.<h2>Do uterine polyps cause tiredness?</h2>Fatigue is associated with uterine fibroids, but it is important to realize that this is simply because they can result in heavy menstrual bleeding.

They can stop the procedure at any time.<h2>How long is uterine polyp surgery?</h2>The procedure generally takes from 5-10 minutes to perform and is called a hysteroscopic (or resectoscopic) polypectomy.<h2>Can an ultrasound tell if a polyp is cancerous?</h2>Although ultrasound is clearly not one of the widely accepted screening techniques, this non-invasive and radiation-free modality is also capable of detecting colonic polyps, both benign and malignant.<h2>Can an ultrasound tell if a fibroid is cancerous?</h2>Medical imaging, including ultrasound and MRI, can be used to tell the difference between fibroids and cancerous tumors in the uterus. Additionally, pathologists (doctors who specialize in analyzing bodily tissue) can look at a biopsy of the fibroid under a microscope and count the dividing cells.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6uLvRrJxmnpmXv7C1w6xkqKpdpbytxc%2Bs</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-worse-fibroids-or-polyps.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-worse-fibroids-or-polyps.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-worse-fibroids-or-polyps.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-worse-fibroids-or-polyps.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-worse-fibroids-or-polyps.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-worse-fibroids-or-polyps.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-rock-lee-married-to-rock-lees-wife-in-boruto-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-rock-lee-married-to-rock-lees-wife-in-boruto-explained.html>Who is Rock Lee married to?
